# Instruction

*xf-Calc* is a user-friendly calculator that performs arithmetic operations with fuzzy numbers. It can help someone to compute, e.g., the area of a wall measuring between 7 and 8 meters in length and about 3.5 meters in height.



# Version
*xf-Calc* requires python 3.10+. It also requires the following packages:


- [Numpy](https://numpy.org) (```python3 -m pip install numpy```)
- [Matploplib](https://matplotlib.org) (```python3 -m pip install matploplib```)
- [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org) (```python3 -m pip install sympy```)
- [Scipy](https://scipy.org) (```python3 -m pip install scipy```)
- [FPDF](https://pyfpdf.readthedocs.io) (```python3 -m pip install fpdf```)

If you would like to run the notebook instead you would also need to install the next package:
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) (```python3 -m pip install notebook```)


## Run

To open *xf-Calc* you should run the next command:

``` bash
python3 fuzzyInterfaz.py
```

If you want to run the notebook instead you should run the following command:

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command should open a browser running Jupyter. Inside there, you should open the file `fuzzyNotebook.ipynb`
