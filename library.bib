abstract = {In this paper we introduce an approach for solving multiattribute decision-making problems in which there are several decision-makers who individually and independently elicit their preferences. The preferences of each decision-maker are imprecise and represented by an imprecise additive multiattribute utility function. We allow for incomplete information on the component utility functions and weights assessment, which leads to classes of utility functions and weight intervals, respectively. On the basis of this information, we introduce an approach for calculating the decision-maker group preferences using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The method consists of assigning trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to weights and component utilities and then, using an additive utility function to perform the evaluation process. The alternatives are then ranked by the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers representing them and the distances to some preset targets, i.e. the crisp maximum and minimum. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract = {A fuzzy number is simply an ordinary number whose precise value is somewhat uncertain. Fuzzy numbers are used in statistics, computer programming, engineering, and experimental science. The arithmetic operators on fuzzy numbers are basic content in fuzzy mathematics. Operation of fuzzy number can be generalized from that of crisp interval. The operations of interval are discussed. Multiplication operation on fuzzy numbers is defined by the extension principle. Based on extension principle, nonlinear programming method, analytical method, computer drawing method and computer simulation method are used for solving multiplication operation of two fuzzy numbers. The nonlinear programming method is a precise method also, but it only gets a membership value as given number and it is a difficult problem for solving nonlinear programming. The analytical method is most precise, but it is hard to $\alpha$ -cuts interval when the membership function is complicated. The computer drawing method is simple, but it need calculate the $\alpha$ -cuts interval. The computer simulation method is the most simple, and it has wide applicability, but the membership function is rough. Each method is illuminated by examples. {\textcopyright} 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

@article{Stefanini2006,
abstract = {We present several models to obtain simple parametric representations of the fuzzy numbers or intervals, based on the use of piecewise monotonic functions of different forms. The representations have the advantage of allowing flexible and easy to control shapes of the fuzzy numbers (we use the standard $\alpha$-cuts setting, but also the membership functions are obtained immediately) and can be used directly to obtain error-controlled-approximations of the fuzzy calculus in terms of a finite set of parameters. The general setting is the Hermite-type interpolation, where the values and the slopes of the monotonic interpolators are given by appropriate parameters and the overall errors of the fuzzy computations can be controlled within a prefixed tolerance by eventually augmenting the total number of pieces (and of the parameters) by which the results are obtained. The representations are designed to model the lower and the upper extremal values of each $\alpha$-cut (compact) intervals of the fuzzy numbers and are able to produce almost any possible configuration (differentiable, continuous or with a finite number of discontinuity points) by using parametric monotonic functions of different types. We show applications in the standard fuzzy calculus and we stress the generality and the applicability of the proposed representation to a large class of problems, including the numerical solution of fuzzy differential equations, the fuzzy linear regression and the stochastic extensions of the fuzzy mathematics. The proposed model is called the Lower-Upper representation and we denote the associated fuzzy numbers or intervals as LU-fuzzy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Giachetti1997,
abstract = {Direct implementation of extended arithmetic operators on fuzzy numbers is computationally complex. Implementation of the extension principle is equivalent to solving a nonlinear programming problem. To overcome this difficulty many applications limit the membership functions to certain shapes, usually either triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFN). Then calculation of the extended operators can be performed on the parameters denning the fuzzy numbers, thus making the calculations trivial. Unfortunately the TFN shape is not closed under multiplication and division. The result of these operators is a polynomial membership function and the triangular shape only approximates the actual result. The linear approximation can be quite poor and may lead to incorrect results when used in engineering applications. We analyze this problem and propose six parameters which define parameterized fuzzy numbers (PFN), of which TFNs are a special case. We provide the methods for performing fuzzy arithmetic and show that the PFN representation is closed under the arithmetic operations. The new representation in conjunction with the arithmetic operators obeys many of the same arithmetic properties as TFNs. The new method has better accuracy and similar computational speed to using TFNs and appears to have benefits when used in engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},
